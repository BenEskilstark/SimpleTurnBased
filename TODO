  - lobby
    - add ready state
    - have a card for each player in the game (and transfer to GoRTS)
    - support named configs and modifying configs in the lobby
    - screen-router should get display intelligently


  - general refactor
    - should be dispatching actions instead of calling this.closest('tag');
    - simplify durations


  - utils
    - SmartMap for json keys instead of encode/decodePos


  - make it easy to extract just the components needed for singleplayer
    - the socket could have all the server code running locally
    - or just something that is guaranteed to be a static site
      and not actually turnbased.


  - queuing actions
    - call queue actions from players; delete dispatchOrQueue
    - action queue per client
    - refactor how/which reducers handle queued actions (turnReducer)
